# A play web app

## Howto

`play idea`

Import or open it in idea

Create a "Play 2 App" run configuration in idea

### Compile views automatically, without idea run configuration

`play ~compile`

## Build & deploy for cloudfoundry

`make deploy`

## Troubleshooting

### New dependencies aren't descovered

`sbt gen-idea update-classifiers`

(gen-idea requires https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea)

### Idea won't compile #1

Project Structure -> Modules -> playing-with-play-java-build -> Dependencies

Change SBT: scala 2.9.1 (generated by `play idea`) to SBT: scala 2.10.0

### Idea won't run "Play 2 App"

Settings -> Play Configuration -> Home: /usr/local/Cellar/play/2.1.1/libexec/

### Sbt looks for e.g. jedis_2.10 which does not exist in central

Do: `"redis.clients" % "jedis" % "2.1.0"`

Don't: `"redis.clients" %% "jedis" % "2.1.0"`
